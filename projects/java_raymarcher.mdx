## What is raymarching?
In short, raymarching is a rendering technique where rays are iteratively marched through a scene, with step size being determined by functions called SDFs.

SDF stands for signed distance function, and it is simply a function defined for a shape that takes in a point, and returns the distance between the shape and the point.

For example, a sphere has an SDF of:
```java
float sphereSDF(vec3 point, Sphere s) {
    return length(s.center() - point) - s.radius();
}
```

## Why is this significant?
Using a raymarching algorithm, any shape that has an SDF can be rendered. This means that scenes that would regularly
