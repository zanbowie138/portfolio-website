## Overview
This is a rendering engine built from scratch with OpenGL and C++ that I've been working on intermittently for a couple years. 

## Features
- **Rendering Engine**
  - The rendering engine is built using OpenGL and implements the graphics pipeline. 
- **ECS Architecture**
  - The engine uses an Entity Component System architecture to manage objects and components.
- **Bounding Volume Hierarchy**
  - The engine uses two different bounding volume hierarchies for collision detection. The first is a dynamic bounding volume hierarchy that is used for broad-phase collision detection, and the second is a static bounding volume hierarchy that is used for narrow-phase collision detection.
- **GUI**
  - The engine uses Dear ImGui for the GUI. Currently, it shows statistics such as FPS, and allows for toggling debug features like showing BVH nodes or regenerating the BVH.
- **Logging System**
  - I created a custom logging system that allows for easy logging of messages both to the console and to a file. It functions using a macro that allows for specifying the log level and the message, and the macro will automatically add the current timestamp and filename to the message.

## What I'm proud of
I first started this project in 2022, with no experience with any systems programming languages or OpenGL. Over the years, I've learned a lot of new things and improved the engine in many ways, and it's in some ways a reflection of how my programming skills and interests have evolved over time. 

## Future Plans
I'd like to continue working on this project, and I hope to eventually have a fully functional physics engine that can be used for rendering simulations.
